# Self-Host Module Map — the campaign tracker

This is the dependency-ordered inventory of the toolchain being re-expressed as
`.napl` modules. It is the tracker for the self-host campaign: every module the
stage0 binary must eventually regenerate from prose, ordered so a generated
module is only depended on by a later gen once it has passed its equivalence
gate.

The unit of self-hosting is a **module** (`rust/crates/napl-core/src/<m>.rs` or
`schemas/<m>.rs`). Each module's hand-written `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` suite is
its **equivalence corpus** — the exact input→output cases the generated code must
reproduce (behaviorally, not byte- or type-identically).

## The pure/IO split decides the phase order

`napl-core` is **entirely pure**: no module under `napl-core/src/` touches
`std::fs`, `std::process`, `std::io`, or `std::env`. It is deterministic
data-in/data-out logic, which is exactly what the behavioral-equivalence gate can
prove. This is why the whole self-host campaign starts and lives in `napl-core`.

All **I/O lives one crate up**, in `napl-cli` (`cmd_*`, `fsutil`, `process`,
`paths`, `clock`) and in `napl-lsp` (the tower-lsp server). Those modules drive
filesystems, subprocesses, and a JSON-RPC loop; their "corpus" is the conformance
suite and the LSP integration tests, not per-function unit vectors. They are a
**later phase** and are inventoried here only for completeness.

## Stage1 swap-in status (SHIPPING)

Phase 1 is not just self-hosted in the harness — it is **swapped in**: the shipping
`napl` binary now runs the generated crates. `napl-core`'s hand-written module
bodies are deleted and replaced by thin adapters over the generated crates
(cross-workspace path-deps; `selfhost/` untouched). **All 23 of 23 modules run
generated code; conformance is 40/40 byte-identical; the escape-hatch list is
empty.**

- **`schemas::journal` — escape-hatch CLEARED.** The generated `read_journal_str`
  previously emitted corrupt-line warning text (`"line 2: expected ident …"`)
  diverging from what conformance `34-journal-corrupt-line` pins byte-for-byte
  (`journal: skipping corrupt line 2 (invalid JSON)`). The `schemas_journal.napl`
  prompt now pins that exact warning as behavior prose plus a byte-exact given/
  expect case, and describes the two-phase parse (arbitrary-JSON syntax check
  first → `(invalid JSON)`; deserialize/validation failure second → the same
  `journal: skipping corrupt line {n} ` prefix). Re-genned on **attempt 1/3**, the
  generated crate now produces the pinned bytes, so `schemas::journal` is a
  straight re-export adapter (no error-message seam) and ships. The equivalence
  gate was extended to assert the warning **text** (9/9, was 8/8).
  (`schemas::frontmatter` remains bridged — its `FrontmatterError` is mapped to the
  pinned message text in the adapter, because the generated `prompts` crate
  composes on `schemas_frontmatter::Frontmatter`.)

See `selfhost.md` → "Stage1 swap-in — DONE" and "Journal escape-hatch cleared +
Phase 2 opened" for the workspace-membership call, the adapter seam catalog, and
the full gate numbers.

## Phase 1 — `napl-core` (pure; the active campaign)

Waves are dependency layers. Wave 1 = pure leaves with **no intra-crate
dependency**. Wave *n* depends only on waves `< n`. Every `napl-core` module is
pure, so the "pure/IO" axis is uniform here; the differentiator is dependency
depth and corpus size.

### Wave 1 — pure leaves (no intra-crate deps)

| Module | LOC | Unit tests | External crates | Self-host status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `body_lines` | 111 | 5 | — | **done** (pilot, re-genned as workspace member in slice 2, 5/5) |
| `extensions` | 141 | 7 | — | **done** (slice 1) |
| `hash` | 44 | 4 | `sha2`, `hex` | **done** (slice 1) |
| `parse_output` | 39 | 3 | — | **done** (slice 1) |
| `text_diff` | 392 | 11 | — | **done** (slice 1) |
| `drift` | 184 | 3 | — | **done** (slice 2, 3/3) |
| `scanner` | 634 | 12 | — | **done** (slice 2, 12/12) |
| `targets` | 272 | 6 | — | **done** (slice 2, 9/9 — corpus grew with the workspace fields) |
| `guard` | 189 | 5 | `serde` | **done** (slice 2, 5/5) |
| `schemas::frontmatter` | 180 | 6 | — | **done** (slice 2, 6/6) |
| `schemas::ir` | 123 | 6 | — | **done** (slice 2, 6/6) |
| `schemas::line_range` | 159 | 8 | — | **done** (slice 2, 8/8) |
| `schemas::ordered_map` | 163 | 4 | — | **done** (slice 2, 4/4) |

Wave 1 is fully self-hosted: **13/13 modules**, 83 equivalence cases green.

Waves 1–3 together: **23/23 modules, 189 equivalence cases green**, escape-hatch
list still empty — all of `napl-core` self-hosts (phase 1 complete).

### Wave 2 — depends only on wave 1

Wave 2 is fully self-hosted: **6/6 modules, 72 equivalence cases green** (slice 3),
each generated on attempt 1 of 3. Every generated wave-2 crate **path-deps the
generated wave-1 crate(s)** it builds on — it composes on the generated code, not
on hand-written napl-core.

| Module | LOC | Unit tests | Intra-crate deps | Self-host status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `blame` | 303 | 13 | `text_diff` | **done** (slice 3, 13/13 — path-deps generated `text_diff`) |
| `reverse` | 297 | 12 | `body_lines`, `schemas` | **done** (slice 3, 12/12 — path-deps generated `body_lines` + `schemas_attribution` + `schemas_line_range`) |
| `schemas::attribution` | 173 | 9 | `line_range` | **done** (slice 3, 9/9 — path-deps generated `schemas_line_range`) |
| `schemas::lock` | 290 | 19 | `extensions` | **done** (slice 3, 20/20 — path-deps generated `extensions`; +1 empty-model case) |
| `schemas::map` | 553 | 10 | `ordered_map` | **done** (slice 3, 10/10 — path-deps generated `schemas_ordered_map`) |
| `schemas::ml` | 185 | 8 | `line_range` | **done** (slice 3, 8/8 — path-deps generated `schemas_line_range`) |

`blame` was confirmed to depend **only** on `text_diff`: its `BlameSourceEntry`
is a blame-local struct, not a `schemas::journal` type, so no wave-3 journal
pull-forward was needed. (`schemas::journal` depends on `blame`, not the reverse.)

### Wave 3 — aggregates over waves 1–2

Wave 3 is fully self-hosted: **4/4 modules, 34 equivalence cases green** (slice 4),
each generated on **attempt 1 of 3**. Every generated wave-3 crate path-deps the
generated wave-1/2 crate(s) it builds on.

| Module | LOC | Unit tests | Builds on (generated crate) | Self-host status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `schemas::journal` | 228 | 8 | `blame`, `text_diff` | **done** (slice 4, 8/8) — **escape-hatch at stage1 swap-in** (warning-text divergence; hand-written body ships) |
| `incremental` | 235 | 2 | `schemas_attribution`, `schemas_line_range` | **done** (slice 4, 3/3 — 2 corpus + 1 composition case) |
| `yaml` | 535 | 9 | `schemas_attribution`, `schemas_ir`, `schemas_ml`, `schemas_line_range` | **done** (slice 4, 9/9 — byte-exact block goldens) |
| `prompts` | 523 | 7 | `schemas_attribution`, `schemas_frontmatter`, `schemas_line_range`, `targets` | **done** (slice 4, 14/14 — 7 corpus + 7 byte-exact pins) |

`lib.rs` (23 LOC, 0 tests) is a pure re-export root and is not a self-host unit.

**Phase 1 (`napl-core`) is COMPLETE: 23/23 modules, 190 equivalence cases green,
every module converged on attempt 1** — and now **FULLY SWAPPED IN**: the shipping
binary runs generated code for all 23 of 23 modules, conformance 40/40
byte-identical, escape-hatch list empty (`schemas::journal` cleared — see the
stage1 status section above). See `selfhost.md` → "Stage1 swap-in — DONE" and
"Journal escape-hatch cleared + Phase 2 opened".

## Phase 2 — `napl-cli` (I/O orchestration; OPEN, batches 1–2 swapped in)

Phase 2 is not behavioral-unit self-hostable the way `napl-core` is — the command
handlers are gated by the **conformance corpus** (`conformance/`, 40 scenarios),
not per-function vectors. But most I/O modules wrap a **pure core** that can be
extracted, generated, and gated by that module's existing pure unit tests. The
discipline is the campaign's: **extract-pure-core, keep-thin-I/O-shell** — split
each module so the deterministic data-in/data-out logic lives in a function the
generated crate can replace, keep the filesystem/subprocess plumbing hand-written
in the shell, and swap the generated pure core in behind the shell's call sites.

**Gate strategy.** The conformance corpus is the behavioral spec for the `cmd_*`
handlers (the fake-agent harness makes gens deterministic); the per-module pure
unit corpora are the equivalence gate for the extracted cores. A pure-core
extraction refactor must keep conformance byte-identical **before** the generated
swap; then the swap must keep it byte-identical again.

### Per-module pure/IO split (the plan)

| Module | LOC | Pure core (self-host unit) | I/O shell (stays hand-written) | Pure unit tests | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `clock` | 65 | `iso_from_millis` (millis → ISO-8601) + civil-date math | `now()` (reads wall clock / `NAPL_FIXED_NOW`) | 3 | **swapped** (`clock_fmt`, batch 1) |
| `paths` | 126 | `resolve_paths` + `NaplPaths` + `rel_to` (path algebra) | `find_prompt_files`/`walk` (readdir) | 1 (`rel_to`) | **swapped** (`paths_core`, batch 1) |
| `statusclass` | 213 | `FileStatus` + `StatusEntry` + `line`/`is_error` (render) | `classify_prompt`/`detect_drift` (fs read + hash) | 2 | **swapped** (`statusclass_render`, batch 1) |
| `driftdetect` | 146 | `reconstruct_file_content` (journal patch replay) | `classify_file`/`detect_gen_drift` (fs read) | 2 | **swapped** (`driftdetect_replay`, batch 1 — composes on generated `schemas_journal` + `text_diff`) |
| `snapshot` | 154 | `diff_snapshots` (hash diff) + `SnapshotFilter`/`make_filter`/`is_excluded_*` (exclusion predicate) | `walk`/`snapshot_hashes`/`snapshot_contents` (readdir) | 2 | **swapped** (`snapshot_diff` batch 1; `snapshot_filter` batch 2) |
| `fsutil` | 70 | — (only the mode constants are pure; every fn is fs I/O) | all (`read_opt`/`write`/`set_mode`/`exists`/`mkdir_parent`) | 0 pure | **shell** (no pure slice with a unit test) |
| `error` | 35 | msg-extraction from `SchemaError` | type + `From` trait glue over hand-written `SchemaError`/`io::Error` | 0 | **shell** (inseparable from caller types) |
| `process` | 435 | — | subprocess spawn + lockfile (all 4 tests are fs I/O) | 0 pure | **shell** |
| `state` | 89 | in-memory state | — | 0 | **shell** |
| `cmd_blame` | 208 | `mode_str`/`format_blame_row`/`why_line`/`render_blame_gen` (byte-exact rendering) | journal read + `blame_file` compute + printing | 7 | **swapped** (`blame_render`, batch 2 — composes on generated `blame` + `schemas_journal`) |
| `cmd_reconcile` | 269 | `editable_drifted`/`build_reconcile_files` (drift → reconcile-input derivation) | drift detect + agent run + journal/map writes | 4 | **swapped** (`reconcile_derive`, batch 2 — composes on generated `drift` + `prompts` + `text_diff`) |
| `cmd_watch` | 191 | `is_ignored` (ignored-dir path predicate) | watcher event loop + debounce + gen dispatch | 2 | **swapped** (`watch_filter`, batch 2) |
| `cmd_gen`/`cmd_status`/`cmd_init`/`cmd_build`/`cmd_test` | ~1370 | orchestration (`cmd_status`/`cmd_init` compose on already-swapped pure cores; no separable untested slice) | I/O + orchestration | 0 | **shell** (conformance-gated) |
| `main` | 184 | — | arg parsing / dispatch | 0 | **shell** |

`cmd_gen` (1133 LOC) is the stage0 orchestrator itself — the last thing to
self-host, and the true fixpoint when it does. The shells shrink as more pure cores
are extracted; a module is only "shell" until its next pure slice grows a unit test.

### Batch 1 — the low-risk leaves (DONE, all swapped in)

Five pure cores generated from behavior-prose prompts in `selfhost/`, each
converged on **attempt 1 of 3**, each gated by that module's exact hand-written
pure unit corpus in the shared equivalence harness, each swapped into `napl-cli`
behind its existing call sites (thin re-export; hand-written pure body deleted;
the unit corpus rides along as the regression net):

| Generated crate | Replaces (napl-cli module's pure slice) | Deps | Equivalence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clock_fmt` | `clock::iso_from_millis` | — | 3/3 (byte-exact ISO strings) |
| `paths_core` | `paths::{resolve_paths, NaplPaths, rel_to}` | — | 2/2 (rel_to + full layout) |
| `statusclass_render` | `statusclass::{FileStatus, StatusEntry, line, is_error}` | — | 2/2 (byte-exact status lines) |
| `driftdetect_replay` | `driftdetect::reconstruct_file_content` | `schemas_journal`, `text_diff` | 2/2 (composes on generated phase-1 crates) |
| `snapshot_diff` | `snapshot::diff_snapshots` | — | 1/1 |

**Batch-1 evidence:** `driftdetect_replay` is the notable one — a phase-2 pure core
composing on **generated phase-1** crates by path (`schemas_journal::JournalEntry`
inputs, `text_diff::{parse_hunks, apply_hunks}` replay). Because napl-core already
re-exports `schemas_journal::JournalEntry` (JOB A) and both crates path-dep the same
`schemas_journal`, the types unify and the shell passes `&[napl_core::schemas::
JournalEntry]` straight through. No extraction refactor was needed: each pure core
was already a cleanly separable function/type in its module, so the swap is a
re-export behind the unchanged call sites, and conformance stayed 40/40
byte-identical across every swap.

### Batch 2 — the derivation/render slices (DONE, all swapped in)

Four more pure cores generated from behavior-prose prompts, each converged on
**attempt 1 of 3**, each gated by that module's hand-written pure unit corpus in the
shared equivalence harness, each swapped into `napl-cli` behind its existing call
sites (thin re-export; hand-written pure body deleted; the unit corpus kept as the
regression net). Three of the four modules had **no** prior unit tests, so a
meaningful corpus was added first (test-only, conformance byte-identical), then an
extraction refactor split the pure core from the I/O shell (conformance byte-
identical again) before the generated swap:

| Generated crate | Replaces (napl-cli pure slice) | Extraction? | Deps | Equivalence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `snapshot_filter` | `snapshot::{SnapshotFilter, make_filter, is_excluded_dir, is_excluded_file}` | added direct filter unit test; made predicates `pub` | — | 1/1 |
| `blame_render` | `cmd_blame::{mode_str, format_blame_row, why_line, render_blame_gen}` | added 7-case corpus; extracted `render_blame_gen` (was inline `blame_gen` I/O) | `blame`, `schemas_journal` | 7/7 (byte-exact blocks) |
| `watch_filter` | `cmd_watch::{is_ignored, IGNORED_DIRS}` | added 2-case corpus | — | 2/2 |
| `reconcile_derive` | `cmd_reconcile::{editable_drifted, build_reconcile_files}` | added 4-case corpus; extracted the two helpers (were inline in the reconcile loop) | `drift`, `prompts`, `text_diff` | 4/4 |

**Batch-2 evidence:** `blame_render` and `reconcile_derive` are the notable ones —
two more **phase-2** pure cores composing on **generated phase-1** crates by path.
`blame_render` renders `blame::BlameLine` rows and `schemas_journal::JournalEntry`
gen-summaries byte-exactly (the `render_blame_gen` block is a single joined string
the shell prints with one `println!`); `reconcile_derive` filters
`drift::DriftedFile`s and builds `prompts::ReconcileFile`s with a
`text_diff::unified_diff("", current)` empty-baseline fallback. Because napl-core
re-exports the same generated types and every crate path-deps the same siblings, the
types unify and each shell passes its already-read data straight through. The only
new discipline vs. batch 1 was that three of the four modules needed a corpus and an
extraction refactor first (batch 1's slices were already cleanly separable); every
extraction kept conformance 40/40 byte-identical **before** the swap, and every swap
kept it byte-identical again.

`error` was re-weighed and **declined again**: its only pure logic is the
`From<SchemaError>` message extraction (`Deserialize(m) | Validation(m) => m`), which
is trait glue inseparable from the hand-written `SchemaError`/`io::Error` caller
types — no separable pure core with a behavioral corpus. `cmd_status`/`cmd_init` were
surveyed and have no separable untested pure slice (they already compose on
batch-1/stage1 pure cores; their remaining logic is fs orchestration).

### Remaining hand-written shell in `napl-cli` (after batch 2)

3,437 LOC total across 18 modules; the pure cores of six are now generated crates
re-exported behind unchanged shells. Hand-written LOC left, by module:

| Module | LOC | Character |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `cmd_gen` | 1,133 | the stage0 orchestrator — the eventual fixpoint |
| `process` | 435 | subprocess spawn + lockfile (all I/O) |
| `cmd_reconcile` | 269 | reconcile orchestration shell (pure derivation swapped to `reconcile_derive`) |
| `cmd_blame` | 208 | blame I/O shell (pure rendering swapped to `blame_render`) |
| `cmd_watch` | 191 | watcher loop shell (pure predicate swapped to `watch_filter`) |
| `main` | 184 | arg parsing / dispatch |
| `statusclass` | 168 | fs classifier shell (pure render swapped to `statusclass_render`, batch 1) |
| `cmd_init` | 162 | scaffold I/O (composes on generated `guard`/`targets`) |
| `snapshot` | 154 | fs walk shell (pure diff + filter swapped to `snapshot_diff`/`snapshot_filter`) |
| `driftdetect` | 138 | fs classifier shell (pure replay swapped to `driftdetect_replay`, batch 1) |
| `state` | 89 | in-memory state + fs read/write glue |
| `paths` | 83 | path shell (pure algebra swapped to `paths_core`, batch 1) |
| `fsutil` | 70 | fs primitives (all I/O) |
| `clock` | 47 | wall-clock read (pure format swapped to `clock_fmt`, batch 1) |
| `error` | 35 | error type + `From` glue (inseparable from caller types) |
| `cmd_test` / `cmd_status` / `cmd_build` | 71 | thin command shells |

The `cmd_*` handlers, `process`, `fsutil`, `error`, `state`, and `main` stay
hand-written shells; the next pure-core extractions with real corpora are scarce
outside `cmd_gen`, which is conformance-gated orchestration and the true fixpoint
when it self-hosts.

## Phase 3 — `napl-lsp` (JSON-RPC server; later)

Gated by the LSP `integration` suite (12 tests). `classify`, `ml`, `convert`,
`context` are pure enough to be pulled forward; `backend`/`navigation`/`hover`/
`diagnostics` are server plumbing.

| Module | LOC | Unit/integration tests | Character |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `integration` | 154 | 12 | end-to-end LSP corpus |
| `ml` | 144 | 4 | pure machine-layer parsing |
| `hover` / `navigation` / `diagnostics` / `backend` / `context` / `classify` / `convert` / `state` / `testkit` / `lib` | ~1500 | 0 | server plumbing |

## Fixpoint definition

The toolchain self-hosts when, for every non-escape-hatch module, stage0-generated
code passes that module's hand-written unit corpus under the shared equivalence
harness. Byte-identity is never required. The campaign is complete when the
generated toolchain can regenerate itself and still pass every corpus.

## Escape-hatch list

Modules that stay hand-written because current stage0 + prompt cannot reproduce
their behavior under the equivalence gate. A module leaves the list only when its
prompt drives a passing generation.

- **Generation:** *(empty)* — no module (phase 1 or phase-2 batch 1) has failed to
  converge (28/28 generated modules on attempt 1).
- **Stage1 swap-in:** *(empty)* — `schemas::journal` was **cleared**: the prompt now
  pins the byte-exact corrupt-line warning (`journal: skipping corrupt line {n}
  (invalid JSON)`) as behavior prose + a given/expect case, the crate re-genned on
  attempt 1 to produce those bytes, and the equivalence gate now asserts the warning
  text (9/9). All 23 `napl-core` modules ship generated code with no seam left on
  the hatch.
- **Phase 2 swap-in:** *(empty)* — batch-1's five pure cores all swapped in with
  conformance 40/40 byte-identical.

## Layout note (RESOLVED in slice 2 — Cargo workspace)

The stage0 gen target dir is fixed at `.napl/src/rust/` per target, and generated
files are locked `0444`. The pilot put `body_lines` **at the crate root**, and
slice 1 landed later modules as **nested package crates** in subdirectories — a
layout that composed only because Cargo silently ignores a nested package from the
root, which also meant the in-gen `cargo test` gate covered only the root crate.

Slice 2 replaced this with a real **Cargo workspace**. The rust target adapter now
carries `workspace_layout = true` and an `attribution_exclude_root_files` list;
the toolchain writes and owns the workspace root `Cargo.toml` (a virtual
`[workspace]` manifest listing every member crate), refreshing it on each gen so a
new module is added as a member before its `cargo test` runs. The root manifest is
treated like the guard files (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md): toolchain-owned, excluded from
attribution (root-level only — per-module `Cargo.toml` files stay attributed), not
locked, not drift-checked. Every module — `body_lines` included — is now a uniform
member crate at `.napl/src/rust/<module>/`, and the in-gen `cargo test` runs at the
workspace root, covering **all 13 members** in one gate. The shared equivalence
harness (`selfhost/equivalence/`) remains the behavioral cross-module gate.
